The multidisciplinary team has built an 11,000-strong force of crowdsourcing volunteers called Community Mapmakers who transcribe suspected racial covenants and have, so far, mapped more than 65,000 racial covenants across multiple states.</p> <p>The racial covenant data and maps they have produced have been instrumental in driving policy change, most notably as evidence that supported Minneapolis' elimination of single-family zoning in 2020. But the project's Community Mapmakers have taught the team that the real value of Mapping Prejudice's process is in the conversations that volunteers have with each other as they are confronted with stark evidence of this country's history of racial discrimination, which both transforms their understanding and inspires them to take more action in their communities. This insight has become the project's guiding principle: The Process is the Product.</p> <p>Mapping Prejudice's Deed Machine software is built with people at the center in a time when loud voices are claiming that LLMs and other AI technologies are the only way to tackle big challenges. But Mapping Prejudice's Geospatial, Technical and Data Lead Michael Corey will argue that too many conversations about scale are focused on solving the wrong problems at a moment where researchers and their institutions desperately need more connection with the communities they purport to serve.</p>"},{"location":"2025/sessions/#panels","title":"Panels","text":""},{"location":"2025/sessions/#geospatial-library-support-services","title":"Geospatial Library Support Services","text":"Panelists will describe and discuss their approaches to providing geospatial support services in their libraries."},{"location":"2025/sessions/#opengeometadata","title":"OpenGeoMetadata","text":"Panelists will describe and discuss their approaches to managing OpenGeoMetadata schemas and sharing repositories."},{"location":"2025/sessions/#workshops","title":"Workshops","text":""},{"location":"2025/sessions/#introduction-to-allmaps","title":"Introduction to Allmaps","text":"Stephen Appel <p>An introduction to Allmaps: What it is and how to use it with digital map collections.</p>"},{"location":"2025/sessions/#new-tools-for-writing-code","title":"New Tools for Writing Code","text":"Eric Larson <p>Large Language Models are everywhere, including all our favorite code editors, terminal windows, and cloud-based integrated development environments.
