### Lightning Talks
   
  * Open-Source Georeferencing and Curating with Allmaps: Presented by Stephen Appel. Allmaps is an open-source, browser-based tool for georeferencing maps, developed in collaboration with Boston Public Library and Leventhal Map and Education Center. Future plans include the Allmaps Curator project for managing georeferenced maps.  
  * Blacklight::Allmaps Plugin: Presented by Eric Larson. A new Ruby on Rails gem for integrating Allmaps with Blacklight/GeoBlacklight, allowing display of georeferenced maps with a tabbed viewer.  
  * GeoServer and Security Challenges: Presented by Maura Carbone. Discussed addressing issues of serving restricted and public content in GeoServer and plans for future upgrades.  
  * Ephemeral Geospatial Data: Presented by Karen Majewicz. Highlighted the issue of data ephemerality and the importance of libraries transitioning from storing print maps to digital data to avoid data loss.
