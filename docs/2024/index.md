# Minneapolis 2024

The University of Minnesota Twin Cities is one of the nation's top public research universities, with an award-winning library system to match. The University of Minnesota Libraries are excited to host the first Geo4LibCamp in the midwest. Come visit the institution that invented the pacemaker, the retractable seat belt, and the Honeycrisp apple. Come meet library colleagues who launched the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org), the [Mapping Prejudice Project](https://mappingprejudice.umn.edu), the [Data Curation Network](https://datacurationnetwork.org), and host the world's largest transgender oral history archive. Wherever your professional interests lie, you'll find your warm and dedicated counterparts here at the University of Minnesota.

Minneapolis is a vibrant and diverse city in the traditional homelands of the Dakota people, and is known for its parks, lakes, art museums, theater, food, and music venues. The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) has been named the "Best Airport in North America" for the second straight year, and the city has great public transportation options. Ride our light rail from the airport directly to your hotel downtown, and immediately curbside to the conference venue on campus.

## Conference Venue

The unconference will be held in the [Elmer L. Andersen Library](https://www.lib.umn.edu/spaces/andersen), which is home to the University's Archives and Special Collections Department. Andersen Library is located at the western end of the Washington Avenue Pedestrian Bridge.
