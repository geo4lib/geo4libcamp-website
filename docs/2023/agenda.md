# Geo4LibCamp Unconference Agenda 2023

Geo4LibCamp is structured as an unconference with suggested topics coming from the participants on the first day of the meeting, but we will also have a few prepared [plenary sessions](sessions.md). Following the camp, on Thursday and Friday, we will have optional post-conference working sessions.
