## Monday, July 24: Foundations and Introductions  
The week began with lightning talks and workshops that set the stage for emerging trends in geospatial metadata and discovery tools:  

- **Karen Majewicz** introduced key concepts in the Aardvark metadata schema.  
- **Eric Larson** demonstrated a streamlined Aardvark workflow application for managing metadata.  
- **Stace Maples** and **Eliot Jordan** presented updates on IIIF extensions, including AllMaps and navPlace, for web-based georeferencing and spatial context.  
- The group previewed **Machines Reading Maps**, a new AI-driven approach to extracting text and features from historical maps.  
- A hands-on workshop introduced participants to geospatial raster and vector data in R.

## Tuesday, July 25: Open Workflows and Mapping Politics  

- The morning included group attendance at the **GIS Librarians for Open Workflows (GLOW)** virtual forum, which focused on instructional design, professional roles, and sustainable GIS education.  
- In the afternoon, **Michal Migurski** gave a keynote on **PlanScore.org**, highlighting how geospatial analysis can help combat gerrymandering by scoring redistricting plans based on fairness metrics.  
- Unconference discussions explored Feltâ€™s mapping tools, collaborative georeferencing project planning, and deeper applications of AllMaps within GeoBlacklight environments.

## Wednesday, July 26: Metadata, Formats, and Community Tools  

- **Brynn Kramer** delivered a keynote on the **Conrad Collection**, revealing how digitization and cataloging workflows uncovered powerful narratives hidden in a historic engineering map collection.  
- Unconference sessions focused on metadata schema alignment (particularly Aardvark), cloud-optimized formats like COGs and PMTiles, and the use of serverless tools to reduce infrastructure complexity.  
- Topics included multispectral imagery workflows, derivative file management, and strategies for integrating georeferenced content into discovery platforms.

## Thursday, July 27: Collaborative Working Sessions  
The day was devoted to group work around shared technical interests. Focus areas included:  

- Enhancing workflows for **Machines Reading Maps** and understanding how AI can improve access and discovery of map content.  
- Implementing IIIF georeferencing workflows with AllMaps and expanding support for annotations and metadata linking.  
- Addressing governance, tooling, and sustainability for the GeoBlacklight and Geo4Lib communities.

## Friday, July 28: GeoBlacklight Working Day  
The final day continued with working sessions around GeoBlacklight development and community direction. Topics included:  

- Optimizing metadata pipelines for ingest and discovery.  
- Comparing cloud-native infrastructure with traditional GeoServer-based architectures.  
- Discussing long-term governance, sustainability, and the evolving scope of the Geo4Lib community.
