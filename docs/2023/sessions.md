The 2020 decennial Census and its subsequent redistricting cycle was one of the most hotly contested line-drawing exercises in U.S. history. After a rapid series of overlapping legislative map proposals, accusations of gerrymandering, political lawsuits, arguments before the Supreme Court, and one nationwide mid-term Congressional election board member Michal Migurski will describe the creation and role of [PlanScore](https://planscore.org), a political science mapmaking project tackling the challenge of making redistricting fair and easy to understand.

### Lessons and stories from the Conrad Collection on Dutch Waterways

:calendar_spiral: Wednesday, July 26, 2023 @9:30 AM PST

:material-video: [Open streaming link](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/96260137958?pwd=OWkvM0w0QWdqT1J3cFlENXpBNXM3QT09)

**Brynn Kramer**

In 1903, [Stanford Libraries purchased the personal library of J.F.W. Conrad](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/vt578hf4454), a renowned Dutch engineer who was a major contributor to hydraulic engineering, land reclamation, and canal infrastructure during the mid to late-19th century. For the next 116 years, some 2,500+ cartographic materials remained locked away until a project focusing on their digitization and cataloging began.  This talk will highlight some of the practices we have implemented to manage the workflow and just a few of the amazing maps and stories we discovered along the way.
