## Workshop

:calendar_spiral: Monday, July 24, 2023 @1:30pm – 3:00pm PST

### Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R

**Kristi Liu and Jon Jablonski**

This lesson covers how to open, work with, and plot vector and raster-format spatial data in R. Additional topics include working with spatial metadata (extent and coordinate reference systems), reprojecting spatial data, and working with raster time series data. [Preview the workshop here.](https://ucsb-dreamlab.github.io/r-raster-vector-geospatial/)

??? Info "Open to view workshop prerequisites"

	* Data Carpentry’s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download the data and install everything before working through this lesson.
	* R Skill Level: This lesson assumes you have some knowledge of R. If you’ve never used R before, or need a refresher, start with our Introduction to R for Geospatial Data lesson.
	* Geospatial Skill Level: This lesson assumes you have some knowledge of geospatial data types and common file formats. If you have never worked with geospatial data before, or need a refresher, start with our Introduction to Geospatial Concepts lesson.
	* Install Software and Download Data: For installation instructions and to download the data used in this lesson, see the Geospatial Workshop Overview.
	* Setup RStudio Project: Make sure you have set up a RStudio project for this lesson, as described in the setup instructions and that your working directory is correctly set.

The 2020 decennial Census and its subsequent redistricting cycle was one of the most hotly contested line-drawing exercises in U.S. history. After a rapid series of overlapping legislative map proposals, accusations of gerrymandering, political lawsuits, arguments before the Supreme Court, and one nationwide mid-term Congressional election board member Michal Migurski will describe the creation and role of [PlanScore](https://planscore.org), a political science mapmaking project tackling the challenge of making redistricting fair and easy to understand.

### Lessons and stories from the Conrad Collection on Dutch Waterways

:calendar_spiral: Wednesday, July 26, 2023 @9:30 AM PST

:material-video: [Streaming link](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/96260137958?pwd=OWkvM0w0QWdqT1J3cFlENXpBNXM3QT09)

**Brynn Kramer**

In 1903, [Stanford Libraries purchased the personal library of J.F.W. Conrad](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/vt578hf4454), a renowned Dutch engineer who was a major contributor to hydraulic engineering, land reclamation, and canal infrastructure during the mid to late-19th century. For the next 116 years, some 2,500+ cartographic materials remained locked away until a project focusing on their digitization and cataloging began.  This talk will highlight some of the practices we have implemented to manage the workflow and just a few of the amazing maps and stories we discovered along the way.
