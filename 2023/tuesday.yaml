- content: 60 minutes<br>The 2020 decennial Census and its subsequent redistricting cycle was one of the most hotly contested line-drawing exercises in U.S. history. After a rapid series of overlapping legislative map proposals, accusations of gerrymandering, political lawsuits, arguments before the Supreme Court, and one nationwide mid-term Congressional election board member Michal Migurski will describe the creation and role of PlanScore, a political science mapmaking project tackling the challenge of making redistricting fair and easy to understand.<br> Michal Migurski is a co-creator of PlanScore.org, a head of data products at Felt.com, a former mapping team leader for Facebook, and a longtime champion of open geodata and the software tools to make it. His many past roles also include Remix.com, Code for America, and Stamen Design.
